  <p>
    I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow,
    working in the <strong>GIST (Glasgow Interactive Systems) section</strong>,
    supervised by <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/xianghuading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Dr. Xianghua (Sharon) Ding</a> and
    <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/shulimho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Dr. Edmond S. L. Ho</a>.
    My research lies at the intersection of <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong>,
    <strong>computer vision</strong>, and <strong>affective computing</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, I am exploring how computer vision techniques can be used to
    <strong>enhance people’s viewing experiences</strong> and
    <strong>assess mental well-being</strong> through facial expression and behavioral analysis.
    By combining machine learning with human-centered design, my goal is to create intelligent systems
    that not only understand human emotions but also support mental health and enrich digital media experiences.
